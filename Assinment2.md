apartment rental prices
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about apartment rental prices in the city of Toronto. The data is provided in a tabular format and is suitable for machine learning tasks, particularly regression problems.
The dataset consists of 1,124 rows and 24 columns. Each row represents a single apartment, while each column represents a specific attribute related to the apartment.
The features in the dataset include apartment size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other property-related characteristics such as geographical coordinates and additional amenities. These features are used as input variables for the machine learning model.
The target variable in this dataset is the apartment price, which is a continuous numerical value. The goal of the machine learning model is to learn the relationship between the apartment features and their prices in order to predict the price of an apartment based on its characteristics.
Since the objective is to predict a continuous numerical value, this problem is classified as a regression problem.
